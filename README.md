Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are only showcasing a sample code that can work as described in this product. To find the official developer of this product, please refer to MQL5.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you need to include the necessary libraries. Make sure you have the `Trade` library installed in your MetaTrader platform.

```csharp
#include <Trade\Trade.mqh>
```

Next, define the main strategy pairs that you want to trade. Modify the `strategyPairs` array with your desired pairs.

```csharp
string[] strategyPairs = {'AUDCAD', 'AUDNZD', 'NZDCAD'};
```

## Strategy Execution

The main strategy execution is handled in the `OnTick()` function. The code follows the following flow:

1. Retrieve and process market data for the defined strategy pairs using the `RetrieveMarketData()` function.
2. Apply the selected strategy to the market data using the `ApplyStrategy()` function.
3. Generate trading signals based on the applied strategy using the `GenerateSignals()` function.
4. Open and close trades based on the generated signals using the `ExecuteTrades()` function.

```csharp
void OnTick()
{
    if (RetrieveMarketData(strategyPairs))
    {
        if (ApplyStrategy())
        {
            if (GenerateSignals())
            {
                ExecuteTrades();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Supporting Functions

The code also includes several supporting functions for different operations:

- `RetrieveMarketData(string[] pairs)`: This function retrieves and processes market data for each pair specified in the `pairs` array.

- `ApplyStrategy()`: This function applies the selected strategy to the retrieved market data.

- `GenerateSignals()`: This function generates trading signals based on the applied strategy.

- `ExecuteTrades()`: This function opens and closes trades based on the generated signals.

Please note that the implementation of these functions is not provided in this code.

## Risk Management and Error Handling

The code mentions the presence of risk management functions, error handling, and logging mechanisms. However, these functions are not implemented in this code. It is recommended to implement proper risk management and error handling mechanisms according to your trading strategy and requirements.

## Testing and Initialization

The code includes an `OnInit()` function, which can be used for testing the code extensively and ensuring its reliability and accuracy. Implement code within this function to perform thorough testing.

```csharp
int OnInit()
{
    // Implement code to test the code extensively and ensure its reliability and accuracy
    // ...
    // ...
    return INIT_SUCCEEDED; // Return INIT_SUCCEEDED if initialization is successful
}
```

## Clean Up

The `OnDeinit(const int reason)` function is provided for cleaning up any used resources when the EA is stopped or removed from the chart. Implement code within this function to clean up any resources that were allocated during the EA's execution.

```csharp
void OnDeinit(const int reason)
{
    // Implement code to clean up any used resources
    // ...
    // ...
}
```
